# How to Get Unbanned on Payday 3 (2025 Guide) 🔫

Getting banned from Payday 3 can feel like a punch in the face — especially if you think it was a total mistake. Don’t worry! This straightforward guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban like a pro to get back to the heisting action ASAP.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban strike as soon as you made a new account? Or does it follow you around like a bad cop across multiple profiles? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Payday 3 is clamping down hard on cheaters by tagging your PC hardware, making it tricky to come back even with fresh accounts.
